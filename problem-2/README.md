# Problem 2 â€“ css layout
- Create html/css layout to position boxes and text on the screen as on the picture
- As a baseline this html can be used and further modified as needed

```html
<div class="main-container">
    <div class="item">Hello!</div>
    <div class="item">Apple a day takes a doctor away!<div>
</div>
```
